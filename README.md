### Current progress: **PRE-ALPHA**

An work in progress attempt to recreate the 1996 version of **Microsoft Interactive CD Sampler** to HTML.

*Explore the interactive worlds of Microsoft consumer products.*

## Want to take a look?
*Please do note that this project is still not finished and is being worked on, so expect some bugs and unfinished features.*

Go to the GitHub Pages instance I have running [here](https://rqfirqfo.github.io/mscdsampler-html/).
or alternatively, you can just download as a zip file and load the index.html from there.

## Goals
- Try and make the UI as accurate as possible to the original software.
- Learn more about HTML and JS
