# MS Interactive HTML Sampler
An attempt to rewrite the 1996 version of Microsoft Interactive CD Sampler into HTML.

## Why?
idk, seems possible.

## Goals
- Try and make this as accurate as possible to the original software.
- Learn jQuery (I have never learned js in my whole life so this is interesting)

## To-do list
See [TODO.md](TODO.md)
